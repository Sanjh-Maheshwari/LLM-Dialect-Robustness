Several of those individuals have since been arrested on fresh offences.\nOpposition immigration spokesman Dan Tehan said it was clear that Direction 99 was having an impact on community safety.\n\"Andrew Giles needs to explain why he won't change this direction and why he won't change it immediately,\" Mr Tehan said.\n\"What this clearly shows is that your ties to Australia are given primacy over everything else. No matter how Andrew Giles tries to spin it, he is endangering the Australian community through the changes he made. Once again, this is a complete mess of the minister's own making.\"\nMr Giles said this week he was seeking urgent advice in relation to Saki, and criticised the AAT's decision to reinstate Saki's visa as \"inconsistent\" with Direction 99.\nAsked on Friday about the number of visa reinstatements that had relied on Direction 99, a spokesman for Mr Giles said the direction placed a \"significant emphasis on serious offending and family violence  which need to be considered in all matters\".",

Some cross the line at some point, and then they get shut down, and a new one takes its place. For example, Cambridge Analytica came down tumbling by interfering in US elections, but they were doing very well when they were doing the same thing all over the world before that.\nThese \"private\" companies work for anyone who pays them well, and as long as they are useful in the long run for Israel/US, they seem to be allowed to operate with certain freedom on what they do, and who they target on a smaller scale.

For the last few months of her life she had constant UTI's and was in a constant state of confusion with them. No doctor came out to see her despite my having to phone the practice every other week and a couple of times an advanced nurse practitioner came out. One morning I had to phone 999 as I couldn't get her to wake and ended up having to perform chest compressions on her. Long story short I had to leave her after a few hours as my sister was taken into hospital that same day and almost passed that night due to sepsis. I thought I was leaving her in good hands and I needed to help my brother in law with my nephews. Anyhoo 6 hours after being taken she was discharged. A subsequent conversation with the advanced nurse practitioner as my mum was found eating tissue paper I mentioned she had just been in hospital and this practitioner said she wouldn't have been discharged if there was anything wrong and asked me if I wanted her in hospital. I said I just wanted what was best for my mum. She gave my mum a once over and said she could only treat what was in front of her despite me saying that my mum wasn't one to be snacking on fucking tissue paper. Anyway another antibiotic was prescribed as it was probably just another UTI. Five days later my mum passed due to sepsis.",

We also felt quality of food could have been much better. A few examples:-The cinnamon toast was flooded with butter, we could n't finish it.-Poached eggs on the Benedict were over cooked( like hard boiled egg)-Dishes were all super basic in execution, an average home cook could have easily done a better job. To top it all, we set outside in area which was nice enough but swarming with flies. I reckon the restaurant can do much more to deal with that, it much more than small nuisance ",

Just visit Again , sushi still as good as how it was. but the hot snack was really disappointed. the mushroom i can only taste the taste of the oil. it make me feel. the vege croquette and the squid stick is taste like full of flour.

As for the customer service  it seems that basic manners and customer service skills do n't exist anymore.

It Macca after all but it would be nice for staff to work on their RBF and treat customers like the ' valued customer ' name printed on the order ticket.

This business is not operating in an ethical way since they have two lines for naan. One line of one pack and another line for more than one pack. Which is ridiculous cos line for more than one pack gets stagnant while one pack line moves since they serve only that line. They need to adopt a number serving system soon I think. Lot of fighting happening there during weekends. Hope the owners think about a better way soon before the council or police intervenes for a pack of naan",

The only con we had was the pillows, for such an incredibly soft bed we had soft pillows too, it would be better to have medium to hard pillows with such a bed.

The next morning the Manager( who was quick to respond to our request) came up to our room to inspect and kicked the unit to get it working again. At least it worked. Not only was the hotel in bad shape, but the city too. There is a TAB just downstairs from the accommodation which attracts the wrong types of people. My son( age 7) dodged a bicycle being thrown in his direction from one of the TAB patrons who was yelling and swearing at another patron, they were about to get into a physical altercation. We crossed the road very quickly! We felt very unsafe. The city is housing many who are doing it tough and sleeping rough and on my morning walk, all I could smell was human urine.

Not recommended. Outdoor seating is there. Advised to sit outside if you are planning for a date or a meeting beacuse the music that they are playing is at high volume and can cause irritation. They got a massive 75 inch television for live matches. Got barista machine. Clean and neat washroom is there. Even if you tell them for rare or medium rare beef steak you will get only welldone UPI and POS is there. Never expect taste consistency.

Chicken lollipops are worst. I got leftover food delivered to me which I ordered through swiggy, chicken was hard to chew and dry. Also, have tasted nalli gosh biryani which is awesome in taste. I can see that the quality is decreasing over the time. We have ordered: mutton hot & sour soup( Rs 145), tandoori half plate( Rs 250), mutton dum biryani( Rs 350). 1. Mutton soup was a bit spicy. Really well. 2. Tandoori was awesome, best tandoori in. Chirala. No resturant in chirala provide Mayo( dawat, kanaka Durga) but they provide. Green chutney was superb. 3. Mutton dum biryani, mouth watering, biryani is soo good and mutton was perfectly cooked and juicy. Must try items: tandoori and mutton dum biryani.

There, a advice that the parking lot is free for the first 20 minutes and thereafter it is chargeable, is exhibited. Hot and cold beverages are available, throughout. Rest rooms are there.

The big screen, state-of-the-art sound system, and comfortable seating create a cinematic experience that is hard to replicate at home. The darkness of the theatre and the lack of distractions help to draw you into the world of the film, allowing you to fully immerse yourself in the story. Watching a movie in a theatre also has a communal aspect, as you share the experience with other audience members. Laughing, gasping, or even crying together can enhance the emotional impact of the film. Overall, going to a movie theatre can be a fun and memorable experience, offering a chance to escape reality for a few hours and enjoy a story unfold on the big screen.",

I really liked the name of the cafe \" Traffic Jam \". I know at Teen Hath Naka( a place or i must say a traffic joint where one has to wait for long time due to traffic. It's in Thane.) we face this issue but coming up with the name of the cafe itself is something different. I liked their interiors it gives a perfect feel where how one waits in long traffics with traffic signal sign and stuff. Also their table is made like a road kinda thing something so unique. They've got some props and also a zebra coloured scooter for photobooth. For all you photogenic people do n't miss to get your selfies and come up with different poses. Coming to what I had here. 1. Flavoured Margarita: I liked this moctail which I felt it had the taste of the strawberry. It was really refreshing. 2. Go slow Indiana Pizza: This pizza had sauted bell peppers, onions, sundried tomatoes and cottage cheese. It really tasted well. The pizza base too was good. Must have. I had been here for a random visit like very very long back but will try something more next time and update my review.",

The seating space is limited and generally packed during weekends. Visit early to get suitable seating space. Perfect place for Anime lovers, Korean drama fans and Harry Potter fans. You get amazing books Collection. You can also buy korean merch from there in house store. Food is AVERAGE. 1 SOJU is non alcoholic. Also you ca n't take away the bottle( Rs.) if you can not finish it. Tastes like appy fizz mixed with Sprite. 2 the Ramen is n't authentic. They use Maggie which is served with deep fried egg and chicken. It's not a korean noodles. The price point is high. Korean fried wings are good. You can give it a try. 3 beverage like-Vietnamese coffee, dalgona coffee, boba tea, is really good. 4 desserts are also worth trying. Overall a good cafe if you are visiting with your date.... but the price point is extremely high for the experience they offer.",

You can learn a lot from Burger King with properly cooked meals golden arches. Also the scented palm oil that golden arches are known use really smells and impacts food negatively especially when the food temperature drops and gets cold as palm oil is solid at room temperature. As with many mainstream burger chains and franchises I find the burgers not served up to 71c cooking temperature. Its always warm and there seems, in the UK no Food and Safety, like the US to require cooking and serving your burger hot at Burger King seriously fix your app. Heck contact me and I'll work with you on it.",

While I understand they are promoting this new technology, the young blonde woman came across as rude in her approach. I did n't receive a paper receipt at the end. After waiting 10 minutes to receive my food, I noticed concerning practices like staff picking their nose while preparing food! Keeping food warm in the fry station. Multiple staff members had untidy uniforms with only one wearing an apron, which made me wonder about the general hygiene standards. While most of the staff seemed totally lost, only two employees who stood out in a positive way and knew what they were doing I do n't know their names but the tall man with glasses who was out the back and the female employee bagging orders at the fry station. I left feeling disappointed by the unclean conditions, poor service and difficult technology. I hope Burger King can work out these kinks because I believe there is an opportunity to improve.",

A staff member referred to me as she / her( I identify as non-binary and my pronouns are they them their, my title is Mx) but I respect that in this day and age we are still brought up that way, I politely corrected her and she was genuinely apologetic about it I assured her it was OK. No offence was taken.:- There is a little wait for room service such as food but they always remember and the attitude and manners are amazing, they do their best to have a bit of chit chat. They were great interacting with my pooch. And the bed they provided, I want it! And the little doggy bag gifts and treats made me emotional because it was so thoughtful! And generous! The standard double I had at first the temperature controls I think froze but they kindly helped me move rooms where they worked helping me carry my belongings. I ca n't thank everyone enough for being so kind with me, polite, friendly, helpful, caring and welcoming. Top quality service.

The skewers were n't well seasoned and I made mention of it. The linguine pasta was cold and so oily. There were no sauces or dips at all and when i asked for chilli I was served mild sriracha sauce swimming in oil The food was so greasy I used up our serviettes wiping oil off my mouth. My husband asked for tomato sauce and was served ketchup Had to force our way through it because we were very hungry. I told the host I did n't enjoy it.

Located at the top of Cambridge St, it is only round the corner from another Wetherspoons, the Wather Works. Benjamin Huntsman was notable for this steel producing town as he invented crucible or cast steel & he opened a plant in Sheffield around 1740. The building is rather interesting inside with itsl industrial elements & overly large pipework. Two coffee machines on the lower floor along with an accesible toilet located to the rear. Other toilets are on the second floor up a staircase-note at the time of visiting, the ladies toilets only flushed if you press both buttons at the same time. Some cubicles gave this instruction but not all, so just bear this in mind if paying a' visit'!",

The original part was built in Norman times( 1114) and the rest was added 1270-1328. There are numerous memorials with a high proportion of Devon soldiers. Numerous historic items can be found with the original mechanics of the large clock above the gift shop on view. The organ pipes are enormous being over 10mtrs tall. Well worth a visit.

But I'll get to that at the end. Sunset Burger: Absolutely lovely, and tasty. Around on its own I believe, and then instead of going for the sides we opted for the loaded fries as another dish instead. The burger as a stand alone item would be. Loaded fries: Do n't get fooled by advertisement. It was 8, and I tasted 5 too much. Firstly the loaded element, which was hard to find any chicken it claimed to have in, I think I counted around 3 strands. And then alot of the loaded, is very central, so you feel there is no flavour else where. The main issue is the flavour / taste, the only way to describe it, is it tasted like the old mini oven pizzas I used to have when I was younger. The taste was identical to that pizza, which was so odd to have that cheap oven pizza taste on chips. It did n't have any unique flavours, or any spice. We had to drown it in hot sauce, to then get Hot Oven Pizza flavour. Honestly I would n't recommend it at all, it's not worth disappointing yourself for 8. Stick to what you know, and get the usual with 2 normal sides. And stay away from the odd flavours loaded fries. Shame!",

The first thing I noticed was the pizza had not been overcooked. The crust golden, like it had been soaking in the rays on a picturesque Caribbean beach. Perfectly moist and spongy as one would expect. Secondly, the cheese was there. Usually I am second guessing myself, wondering if I had accidentally clicked the' Extra Dough' option when ordering, rather than extra cheese. This time it had visibly slid across the surface of the pizza in transit due to the sheer weight and consistency-something that I wo n't deduct points for. Anyway, having a few slices with a bit less cheese, knowing you are going to reach those absolutely coated came as quite an exciting and almost tense ordeal. The sauce was plenty ladled, and because the pizza was n't overcooked, the toppings were juicy and tender. Remember, if we want pepperoni crisps we will just buy them from the shop. I guess this time the person preparing the pizza is a connoisseur themselves; or they just care about their customers. All in all, great experience.",

Inside the place is spacious with plenty of seating for eating food and drinks, quite a few arcade games are also available; some you can win tickets on these can be exchanged for prizes. The bowling itself is well maintained and set out allowing up to 6 people per lane, we had 2 lanes next to each other for our group.

The second waitress was a little too eager to take our order; we had only just started looking through the menu, but was happy to wait. We eventually settled on the choc chip cookie dough with salted caramel ice cream( of which there is a vast choice of flavours), a strawberry gelato milkshake, and the Brookie. We were also given a taster plate of 4 macarons. These were far less favourable than our order. The waitress was n't sure of the flavours, but we guessed at 2 x coffee, which we did nt try as we dislike coffee, 1 x pistachio, which did nt taste of anything, and 1 x strawberry, which was quite nondescript, just sweet. As they were complimentary it did nt matter much but if we had paid for a box of them, we would be disappointed, from what we tried. All of them were prepared quickly and were delicious, the Brookie being a particular favourite. Although parking is a bit of an issue, particularly for those who are less able, we are looking forward to coming back again, and will likely recommend it.",

But then you have to spend more energy refrigerating the hydrogen, and it's so cold it embrittles the pipes etc which have to be frequently replaced, it leaks and so on.\nIn the Space Shuttle programme, only 55% of the liquid hydrogen was actually burned in the rocket engines - the rest was lost in transit, evapourated in storage and so on. 12.6% was lost simply transferring it from a tanker truck to a storage tank.\nSo then you are in effect spending 1.6 x 1/0.55 = 2.91 units of energy to get 1 unit of useful hydrogen. Of course, we might suppose that we are going to be more efficient and effective than an agency which has half a century of experience handling liquid hydrogen and has spent billions of dollars trying to make it more efficient and effective, but this seems unlikely.\nThis only works if we have some massive surplus of renewable electricity which we have no other use for, so that we don't care that most of it is wasted in the process. Given that fossil fuels are still being used for about 2/3rds of the country's electricity, this seems unlikely to happen in the near future.\nAt the moment, the \"green hydrogen\" movement is simply a way for mining companies to squeeze more money from the public revenue.

                    "text": ">The attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, said the reform would protect any Victorian who made a report to police, granting them complete immunity if their alleged perpetrator tries to bring a defamation suit against them.\nAllegations usually result in the person alleged having their freedom compromised very quickly through being detained or bailed, regardless if they are actually innocent. As we have seen in other recent developments of making bail harder to obtain, the net result of allegation is effectively punishing a person in advance of determining their guilt by using the justice system process against them.\nOnce in the justice system, mud sticks even if the alleged criminal is proven not guilty. Until recently, innocent people could better protect themself against the effects of false allegation by taking defamation action, but this new legislation appears to block that avenue, meaning the justice system would now effectively be protecting people making false allegations.\nI acknowledge the issue of people being fearful of coming forward to report crimes, however a balance needs to be struck here against the ability to punish people through mere allegation, which may also be false, in advance of a judgement of guilt.\nThe proposed legislation appears to effectively grant accusers immunity from false allegations.\nIn our system of justice, the costs of making allegations is borne by the state, however the cost of defense, including defending their reputation, against allegations is usually borne by the defendant. Part of this defense is the ability to raise defamation action against false accusation. Without that option, the defendant is subject to public slander and loss of freedom as punishments in advance of even proof of guilt, based merely on allegation. Even if proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt fails, the defendant is not compensated for the loss of public standing and the punishment already meted out by the justice system in advance of the verdict.\nWhilst I understand the court has some leeway to punish an accuser for false allegations, this is not prescribed.\nJustice is supposed to be for both accused and accuser, but we are increasingly seeing justice be applied in favour of the accuser, allowing false or unfounded accusations to punish the accused, regardless of the outcome of the court.\nCrimes need to be objective harms of import, because our system of justice already punishes people based on allegation only, regardless of their guilt, which stretches the integrity of justice and the presumption of innocence. To also punish people, regardless of their guilt, as revenge for subjective hurt feelings would be outrageous, however many crimes are just that, based on subjective hurt feelings and not objective harms.\nI urge the justice system not to keep lowering the threshold to criminal activity, so that false accusations can more easily be used to punish innocent people regardless of the court judgement.\nI think society has lost focus of the principle of justice to more easily allow the revenge punishment of innocent people for subjective hurt feelings and for advantage. We have to find a better method of progressing justice that honours both the accused and accuser equally along with the presumption of innocence.\nIf a crime is of sufficient import and true, then it is worthwhile pursuing and if that is still having a chilling effect on coming forward, then we need to address why that is, not develop knee-jerk legislation to make it easier to punish people through using the justice system itself on unfounded or false allegation as revenge for subjective feelings.\n>This perception that victim-survivors will be sued for speaking up can sometimes become a reality when they are threatened with defamation suits.\nIf an allegation is truthful, why would a defamation action succeed? Making a threat is pointless and has no power if it can't be carried out: that is where reason comes into the equation instead of capitulating to fear and paranoia.\nHowever, I recognise that defamation law has severe limitations and I believe it needs to be re-evaluated along with the judicial process to return to the fundamental principles of justice.",

They don't want to be the lowest paid police force in Australia.\"  \nThe AFPA is urging members to vote no to the AFP pay offer, which includes increases to allowances on top of 11.2 per cent in wage rises over three years.\nIf the offer is rejected, Mr Caruana said the union would examine applying to the Fair Work Commission for a protected action ballot order to authorise more significant industrial action. \"It's difficult for the AFP to do any strike action, or withholding of labour action, because of the implications to national security,\" he said. \"What I can say is that we are engaging some lawyers to look at what our options are in that space. \"We would consider that if we were to withdraw some labour from the airports, and we were to withdraw labour from places like Parliament House, from places like ANTSO and a few other places like Holsworthy etc, we're not actually putting the community at risk. \"If the airports continue to operate, the airports are then taking on that risk. If parliament chooses to sit, the parliament is then taking that risk but we are currently getting legal advice as to whether or not under the AFP Act, that would be in breach of national security and a step too far. We will consider any measures necessary to get the point across to government and the AFP that they need to offer a fair wage deal for AFP members.\"",

Like I worked 2583 hours last financial year but because it wasn't 8 hrs a day 6 days a week, every week I don't get permanent.\nAlso as someone whose been casual for a while, other things have changed, like how long before a shift begins that they are scheduling something , places are literally getting calls from clients and saying yeah we can do that today for you, then ringing around staff to see whose available. It's shifting the risk/cost of business from the employer to the employee.\nThe law hasn't caught up with technology, I've talked to people who did my job more than 30 years ago, casual wasn't a thing because most people didn't have mobile phones, so they paid people to be on call, they don't anymore because everyone has a mobile so if I don't answer they'll try someone else and eventually someone will pickup and agree to come in. I've brought that up with the union and again they don't care.\n I want at a minimum what a friend in the US told me that they were proposing in his state ( can't remember if it went through) they were proposing a minimum notice period for temps ( what they call casuals) of 72hrs. A shift had to be scheduled with a person assigned to it at least 72 hours in advance. The only exception was if  someone called in sick. The Idea was to make businesses go back to putting people on call.",

This is a misconception fueled by silliness and exoticism. The famous list of Australia having nearly all of the world's most venomous snakes comes from a terrible LD50 study that only used five or so overseas snakes for comparison. To get a more accurate impression of relative venom toxicity, check out Dr Bryan Greig Fry's LD50 page.\nFor the question of why we have so many venomous snakes here to begin with, one has to look at the dispersal of snakes within Australia. First there was the best snakes of all (fact), the Aspidites-- primitive snakes that branched off the snake family before pythons evolved. Australia was pretty empty with just these guys around, so when the elapids came down from Asia, there was lots of space for them to diversify into. Elapids are very venomous snakes with fixed front fangs: cobras, mamba, etc. All venomous snakes in Australia are descended from these elapids.\nAustralia has pretty venomous snakes because they all came from highly venomous stock. Since elapids were the main game in town for so long, they diversified to take over all niches, from super-venomous (which get a lot of attention) to nearly lacking venom all together (which no-one pays much attention to!). So Australia has a diverse range of venomous snakes, not just highly venomous ones. Focusing on the big hitters and making ridiculous guesses as to why they're here is missing the bigger picture.\nThe very venomous sea snakes that we have are simply land elapids that diversified into the oceans.\nOur spiders are not more venomous that those of anywhere else in the world. We haven't had a spider-bite fatality since the'50s, and even then it was children and the elderly that succumbed.\nSouth America and Africa have many more venomous species than Australia, including more venomous lizards and venomous mammals (!).\nEdit: I worked out some ratios of lethal snakes:non-lethal snakes for a few different countries here. Australia ain't so bad.",

Contacting fair work too? If you spent this time being productive who knows what you could achieve.  Unbelievable \nSounds very entitled and painful to be honest. If I were the manager and faced with these expectations I'd probably give shifts to the more organised and less demanding staff. The last thing I would do in your position is rock the boat if I wanted to keep my job. \nIf I were your colleague I would be furious that you want  to get paid 3 hours extra for a meeting that would never had occurred in the first place had you done the right thing and that I have to pick up the slack too... I'm sure in the EBA it is a requirement to call in sick at a certain time. You can't pick and choose which parts you agree with grow up!",

He was provided an AC Cab, an armed Escort and contact info for all District election officers ( DM) in the region. He left home two days before the election with the Observer, travelling through remote polling booths making sure fair elections are being held. Calling police forces were needed, diffusing tense situations and returned home in the evening after the elections were done. \nHe was accommodated in good hotels and guest houses, circuit houses, private guest houses of industries though he had hardly any time to eat or sleep. On the election eve, he got a call from a presiding officer of a booth about a broken machine. He went to the room of the DM of the district who was staying in the same guest house. DM opened the door, while talking on the phone on his shoulder while feeding the baby with a bottle. \nSome people will be like, so what if government employees have to work hard for a few days, most people work hard everyday. That's true, the only difference is that in case of election duty, every mistake is a fireable offense with jail time.

That would house an additional 200k people. We could literally triple our prison population and still be saving money. This whole economic benefit of releasing people is a myth.\nPeople have this fairy tinted view that everyone can be reformed, they can't. It's not uncommon for prolific offenders to have anywhere from 100-300 convictions. Releasing them does nothing but bring more misery into their local communities because it is a certainty they will reoffend.\nThe whole myth around increased punishment isn't a deterrent argument falls apart as well when scrutinised. How many of you would walk down the streets in the UK and smoke a joint? - Not worried about it right.. - Now how many of you would do the same in Singapore or Dubai? - Not so willing to are you, why? - Because you are shit scared of the consequences there, don't nobody want to go to a Dubai Jail.\nThis country really needs to start investing in some fuck around and find out laws.",

For the last few months of her life she had constant UTI's and was in a constant state of confusion with them. No doctor came out to see her despite my having to phone the practice every other week and a couple of times an advanced nurse practitioner came out. One morning I had to phone 999 as I couldn't get her to wake and ended up having to perform chest compressions on her. Long story short I had to leave her after a few hours as my sister was taken into hospital that same day and almost passed that night due to sepsis. I thought I was leaving her in good hands and I needed to help my brother in law with my nephews. Anyhoo 6 hours after being taken she was discharged. A subsequent conversation with the advanced nurse practitioner as my mum was found eating tissue paper I mentioned she had just been in hospital and this practitioner said she wouldn't have been discharged if there was anything wrong and asked me if I wanted her in hospital. I said I just wanted what was best for my mum. She gave my mum a once over and said she could only treat what was in front of her despite me saying that my mum wasn't one to be snacking on fucking tissue paper. Anyway another antibiotic was prescribed as it was probably just another UTI. Five days later my mum passed due to sepsis.",
